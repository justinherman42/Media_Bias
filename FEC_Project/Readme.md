# Looking into FEC Individual level fundraising for Democratic Party

The FEC requires candidates file their contributions for the 2020 elections with the agency.  The data is uploaded as forms which the FEC cleans and adds to CSV files.  The data is a treasure-trove of information.  Polls get attention from week to week, but the news generally lacks any deep analysis of the FEC filings.  Reporting typically covers headline numbers advertising total volume of donations and total amount.  The FEC data is rich with self-identifying donor information.  People identify their position, industry and location. Money acts as a proxy for electoral success. In the 2020 primary almost all candidates have sworn off contributions from lobbyists.  On the surface, this is a noble attempt by democratic candidates to prove they aren't influenced by corporations.  However, digging below the surface, there is plenty of corporate influence in the FEC data.
