## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:





```{r}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(lubridate)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
url  <- "http://api.epdb.eu"
path <- "eurlex/directory_code"

raw.result <- GET(url = url, path = path)
names(raw.result)

print(raw.result$status_code)


#team wins over 16 games 

# pages <- get_prices_json$total_pages
# for(i in 2:pages){
#  
#  #Making an API call that has page_number= at the end. This will increment by 1 in each loop until you have all pages
#  call_2 <- paste(base,endpoint,"?","ticker","=", stock,"&","page_number=", i, sep="")
#  
#  #Making the API call
#  get_prices_2 <- GET(call_2, authenticate(username,password, type = "basic"))
#  
#  #Parsing it to JSON
#  get_prices_text_2 <- content(get_prices_2, "text")
#  
#  #Converting it from JSON to a list you can use. This actually gives you a list, one item of which is the data, with the rest is information about the API call
#  get_prices_json_2 <- fromJSON(get_prices_text_2, flatten = TRUE)
#  
#  #This grabs just the data you want and makes it a data frame
#  get_prices_df_2 <- as.data.frame(get_prices_json_2)
#  
#  #Now you add the data to the existing data frame and repeat
#  get_prices_df <- rbind(get_prices_df, get_prices_df_2)
# }
```
